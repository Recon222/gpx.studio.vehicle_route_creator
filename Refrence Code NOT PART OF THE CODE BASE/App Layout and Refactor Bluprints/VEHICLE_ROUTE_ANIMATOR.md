# Vehicle Route Animator Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
A refactor of GPX Studio to create a specialized vehicle route animation system. This tool will allow users to create and animate vehicle routes when GPS infotainment data is not available but vehicle movements are known from CCTV footage or other sources.

## Core Functionality
- ✅ Create routes by placing anchor points that snap to roads
  - ✅ OpenStreetMap road network integration
  - ✅ Interactive point placement and dragging
  - ✅ Segment insertion between points
  - ✅ Context menu for point deletion
- ✅ Assign precise timestamps to individual anchor points
  - ✅ Optional notes field per anchor point
  - ✅ Per-anchor timestamp picker on point placement
  - ✅ Keyboard entry support for timestamps
- ✅ Animate vehicles along routes with precise timing control
  - ✅ Smooth interpolation between points
  - ✅ Heading calculation and rotation
  - ✅ Position tracking
  - ✅ Time-based movement
- ✅ Provide flexible playback controls with variable speeds
  - ✅ Play/pause functionality
  - ✅ Speed selection (0.5x to 20x)
  - ✅ Interactive timeline scrubbing
  - ✅ Time range filtering
- ✅ Maintain GPX format compatibility for import/export
